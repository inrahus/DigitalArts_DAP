            <h2>
                Bachelor of Arts: Digital Arts
            </h2>
            <p>
                The BA in Digital Arts is a 4 Year Professional Degree that allows you to tailor your specialisation,
                and also gives you a useful, broad skillset. It is an Honors-equivalent that combines the artistic,
                technical and critical skills that
                equip you to be an innovator, practical problem-solver, as well as a critical thinker and artist.
                <br>
                <br>
                Your first year, and what is know as the Anologue year, includes core academic and professional concepts
                such as:
                <br>
                Game Design
                <br>
                Storytelling & Drawing
                <br>
                Critical Arts Analysis
                <br>
                <br>
                And from second year, when we move into digital development, we also address:
                <br>
                Programming
                <br>
                3D Modeling and Animation
                <br>
                <br>
                Once you move into the 3rd and 4th year levels of study, you continue with critical theory, and choose
                your
                specialisations from a range of professional majors, namely:
                <br>
                Game Design
                <br>
                Animation
                <br>
                Writing
                <br>
                Interactive Media
                <br>
                <br>
                In the senior years, you will be able to experiment with growing technologies like VR and AR, and
                produce
                large-scale creative projects. We will be sending you off with a broad portolfio with which to enter
                industry.

                Bachelor of Science in Engineering: Digital Arts
            </h2>
            <p>
                The BEngSc in Digital Arts is a 3 Year Degree in the School of Electrical and Information Engineering
                including subjects from Digital Arts. The combination of information engineering and creative production
                gives you a broad range of critical and technical skills. This equips you to enter the technology sector
                with an unique perspective: blending software development, systems thinking, and creative application.
                <br>
                <br>
                The BEngSc Digital Arts has a set curriculum. Subjects taken in the School of Electrical and Information
                Engineering include Maths, Physics, Mechanics, Electric Circuits, Microprocessors, Software Development,
                Data Structures and Algorithms amongst others. In Digital Arts the focus is on Game Design and
                Interactive Media.
                <br>
                <br>
                After you’ve graduated, you can enter industry or continue into the professional BSc Degree in
                Electrical and Information Engineering. You can also opt to complete your BA Honours degree, in which
                you will be able to experiment with growing technologies like VR and AR, and produce large-scale
                creative projects.

                creative
                practical major in which students write their own briefs and work with mentors over a semester to
                geenrate work in their field of interest) and a choice of one other practical subjects. Applicants
                can
                choose from Animation (2D OR 3D OR Experimental), Interactive Media, Writing and Interactivity or

            <h4>
                Masters & PhD
            </h4>
            <p>
                The Masters degree is aimed at students with a strongly articulated research interest. Research can
                be
                produced
                as written academic research or as a combination of written research and practice research. All
                applications are dependent on supervisor availability, so potential candidates are urged to identify
                a supervisor and consult with them before making an application. The two research path include:
                <br>
                <br>
                1. Purely academic research, in which the candidate is expected to produce only a written
                dissertation.
                <br>
                <br>
                2. Combination of academic and practice research. in which the candidate is expected to produce a
                smaller
                written dissertation along with a body of practical work. The weighting can be either 50 / 50 or 60
                /40,
                dependent on the scope of the project. The dissertation should provide a theoretical framework as
                well
                as an analysis of the practical work produced. A permanent record of the practical production must
                accompany the dissertation.
                <br>
                <br>
                The areas of research which are
                available include:
                <br>
                <br>
                <i>Animation</i>
                <br>
                Research topics for Animation include animation history, theory, practice and production systems, or

                creative / arts practice, interactivity and development, digital innovation, social media, mobile
                media,
                user-focused design or South African and African digital media development and theory.
                <br>
